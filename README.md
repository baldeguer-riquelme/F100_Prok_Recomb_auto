# F100_Prok_Recomb_auto
This repository contains the information to run the F100 pipeline developed by Roth Conrad (https://github.com/rotheconrad/F100_Prok_Recombination/tree/main) to estimate recombination between genomes calling a single script.

The F100_main.py compile the scripts in the original F100_Prok_Recombination repository to make it easier to use. It might be specially useful for those trying the pipeline for the first time or with little experience. However, the users looking for more flexibility might want to run the pipeline script by script, as originally developed.
